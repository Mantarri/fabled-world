# Fabled World
World Generator for Fabled Auburn
## Godot Module Requirements:
- Godot Voxel - https://github.com/Zylann/godot_voxel
- FastNoiseSIMD - https://github.com/tinmanjuggernaut/godot_fastnoise_simd

Currently the best way to use get both modules together for Godot 3.2.2 is to use a precompiled binary for both,
available here, along with export templates. http://tokisan.com/godot-binaries/
